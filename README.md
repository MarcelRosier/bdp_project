## Dataset

The dataset is a merge of 3 main sources:

- [Suicide Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016)
- [GINI Dataset](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI?end=2021&most_recent_value_desc=true&start=2021&view=map)
- [Healtcare Coverage Dataset](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?ThemeTreeId=9)

The base Suicide Dataset was extended to grant more features for modeling.
For this purpose we searched for possible datasets that could match factors listed here: https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/factors/index.html.
For most features it's hard to find proper datasets that cover a variety of countries and years.
As a compromise we added the Healthcare dataset (access to healthcare is listed as a factor) and additionaly added the GINI dataset to account for factors that might be related with social inequality.

## EDA

`TODO`

## Data cleaning

All data cleaning and loading code is in [utils.py](mental_health/utils.py)

### Suicide Dataset | `load_suicide_data()`

- Drop columns:
  - 'HDI for year': too much missing data
  - 'country-year': redundant
- Rename columns:
  - 'suicides/100k pop' => 'suicides_per_100k_pop'
  - ' gdp_for_year ($) ' => 'gdp_for_year',
  - 'gdp_per_capita ($)' => 'gdp_per_capita'
- Drop data from 2016 due to missing datapoints
- Drop all datapoints of countries that have less than 3 years of data
- Add columns (done using [pycountry](https://pypi.org/project/pycountry/) and [pycountry_convert](https://pypi.org/project/pycountry-convert/)):
  - 'country_code'(useful for joing with oder datasets)
  - 'continent' (useful for visualizing)

### GINI Dataset |Â `load_gini()`

- Melt the dataframe to get tidy columns (from a column for each year to a single year column)
- Rename columns:
  - 'Country Name' => 'country',
  - 'Country Code' => 'country_code'
- Set type of year column to int (was string before)
- Filter to only contain years $\in [2010; 2015]$

### Healthcare Dataset | `load_healthcare()`

- Remove data for Spain and Russia due to missing entries
- Rename columns:
  - 'COU' => 'country_code',
  - 'Country' => 'country',
  - 'Year' => 'year',
  - 'Value' => 'healthcare_coverage'
- Filter to only contain years $\in [2010; 2015]$

## Data Loading

### Merge datasets | `load_suicide_healthcare_gini_df()`

- Load suicide dataset and filter to range $\in [2010; 2015]$
- Load GINI data and only select columns: ['country_code', 'year', 'gini']
- Load Healthcare and only select columns: ['country_code', 'year', 'healthcare_coverage']
- Merge Healthcare and GINI data on 'year' and 'country_code'
- Merge filtered Suicide df with previous merge results on 'year' and 'country_code'

### Preprocessing | `get_train_test_split()`

To make the data suitable as input for our models some columns have to be converted to numerical values. Additionaly the data has to be separated into feature and label parts and split into a train and test set. (maybe also a validation set later)  
Code in [utils.py](mental_health/utils.py).

- Conversions:  
  country, continent, sex and age are converted to numerical values
  ```python
  # example for country column
  df.country = pd.Categorical(df.country).codes
  ```
- Feature/ Label split:  
   We want to predict the number of suicides based on a set of input features. We experimented with choosing only a subset of available features but using all yielded the best results. Hence we chose:

  - Features:  
     `['country', 'continent', 'sex', 'age', 'year',
'gdp_per_capita', 'healthcare_coverage', 'gini', 'population']`
  - Label: `['suicides_no']`

- Train/ Test split:
  Since we want to predict future suicide rates we split the data into:
  - Training: data $\in [2010; 2014]$; 1788 samples ~ 86,6%
  - Test: data $\in [2015]$; 276 samples ~ 13,4%
  - ?TODO: split Test into Test and Valdiation?
